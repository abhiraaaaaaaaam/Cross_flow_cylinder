# Cross_flow_cylinder
This repository contains simulation files for the uniform cross-flow and heat transfer over a heated cylinder and the correlations between Nusselt, Reynolds and Prandtl Numbers. The simulation has been done in COMSOL Multiphysics and is submitted as part of the course project of ES 607 Foundations of Fluid Dynamics course here at IIT Gandhinagar.
